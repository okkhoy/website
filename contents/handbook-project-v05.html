<h3>V0.5 Demo</h3>
<div id="handbook-project-v05-demo"></div>
<img src="../images/v05demo.png" style="width: 250px"><br>

<br>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Venue:</strong> Same as the tutorial venue.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Duration:</strong> Strictly no more than 12 minutes. Exceeding this limit will be penalized.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Schedule:</strong> Your demo timing is same as your tutorial time in week 13. <br>
    Starting times: <code>Team B1: 00 minutes, B2: 15 minutes, B3: 30 minutes, B4: 45 minutes</code><br>
    At least some team members need to arrive 15 minutes ahead of the allocated time to set up your computer.<br>
    There is an <span class="highlighted">automatic penalty if you are not ready to start on time.</span>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Target audience</strong>: Assume you are giving a demo to a higher-level manager of your company, to
    brief him/her on the current capabilities of the product.<br>
    The scenarios you demonstrate should be chosen judiciously so that you cover the full range of your product's
    functionality. Give more time to stronger features (i.e. cover mundane/basic features fast).
    It is recommended you showcase how the product improves the user’s workflow rather than simply
    describe each feature.<br>
    No need to cover design/implementation details as the manager is not interested in those details.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dress code</strong> : The level of formality is up to you, but it is recommended that the whole team dress
    at the same level.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Testing: </strong>
    All team member should remain in the holding area during the tutorial slot (when you are not doing the demo)
    because our testers might need to communicate with you during the testing.<br>
    Holding area for Active Learning Room: Unused area of the room (enter by the door near the staircase)<br>
    Holding area for SR5: Tables outside SR5
  </li>
  <li><strong>Structure:</strong><br>
    Demo the product using the same executable you submitted, on your own laptop, using the TV.<br>
    Every team member should take part in the demo. However, it's ok for one member to do all the typing.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Optimizing the time:</strong><br>
    Try to make the maximum use of the short demo time in the following ways,
    <ul>
      <li>
        Spend as much time as possible on demonstrating the actual product.
        Not recommended to use slides (if you do, use them sparingly) or videos or lengthy narrations.<br>
        Avoid skits, re-enactments, dramatizations etc. This is not a sales pitch or an informercial.
        While you need to show how a user use the product to get value, but you don’t need to act like an
        imaginary user. For example,
        [Instead of this]<code>Jim get’s a call from boss. "Ring ring", "hello", "oh hi Jim, can we
        postpone the meeting?" "Sure". Jim hang up and curses the boss under his breath. Now he starts typing
        ..etc.</code><br>
        [do this] <code>If Jim needs to postpone the meeting, he can type …</code><br>
        It’s not that dramatization is bad or we don’t like it. We simply don’t have enough time for it. <br>
        Note that CS2101 demo requirements may differ. Different context → Different requirements.
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>
        Rehearse the steps well and ensure you can do a smooth demo.
        <span class="highlighted">Demos that are clearly under-prepared will be penalized.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are not deft with using the laptop’s touchpad, please bring a mouse.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don’t waste time repeating things the target audience already knows.
        Assume the target audience knows that the product is a task manager targeting Jim-like users.
        That means no need to explain those things again.<br>
        Also assume the target audience knows who you are.
        That means no need to say things like "We are students from NUS, SoC".
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring sufficient amount of sample data and know how to load them to the system. You should not plan to type all
        the sample data during the demo itself. On the other hand, trying to demo a product using just a couple of
        sample tasks creates a bad impression too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plan the demo to be in sync with the impression you want to create. For example, if you are trying to convince
        that the product is easy to use, show the easiest way to enter a task before you show the full command with all
        the bells and whistles.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
