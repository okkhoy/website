<h3>Policy on following instructions</h3>
<div id="policy-followingInstructions">
  <p>When working with others, especially in a large class such as CS2103,  it is very important
    that you adhere to standards, policies, and instructions imposed on everyone. Not doing so creates
    unnecessary headaches for everyone and sends negative signals about your work attitude. That is
    why we deduct participation points for not following instructions carefully.</p>
</div>

<h3>Policy on grading smaller/larger teams</h3>
<div id="policy-teamSize">
  <p>We do take team size into account when grading.</p>
  <p>3 member teams are allowed to do slightly less than 4 member teams (i.e., 10-15% less) and 5
    member teams are expected to slightly more than 4 member teams (i.e., 10-15% more). The variation
    of expected output is less than 25% (although the variation in team size is 25%). This is to
    account for the fact that extra people adds to the communication overhead.</p>
</div>

<h3>Policy on project work distribution</h3>
<div id="policy-workDistribution">
  <p>It is OK to do less or more than equal share in your project team. However, be prepared to receive a
    different grade than your team members if you didn't do an equal share.</p>
  <p>Everyone is expected to do a write back-end code, frontend code, tests, user documentation, and developer
    documentation. If you limit yourself to tasks like documentation only, you are likely to fail the project
    component.</p>
</div>

<h3>Policy on absence due to valid reasons (e.g. MC, LOA, University events)</h3>
<div id="policy-validAbsences">
  <p>There is no need to inform us. If you miss a lecture/tutorial for a valid reason, just do your
    best to catch up. We'll be happy to help if required. An occasional absence or two is not expected to affect your
    participation marks. <br/>
    Only if you fail to earn full marks for participation we will consider giving an alternative avenue to earn marks
    missed due to the absences. <br/>
</div>

<h3>Policy on email response time</h3>
<div id="policy-responseTime">
  <p><span class="highlighted">I will respond to you within 24 hours</span> if it was an email sent
    to me or a forum post directed at me. If you don't get a response within that time, <span
        class="highlighted">please feel free to remind me</span>. It is likely that I did not notice your
    post or the email got stuck somewhere.</p>
  <p>Similarly I expect you to check email regularly and respond to emails written to you personally
    (not mass email) promptly.
  </p>
  <p></p>

  <div class="additional-info">
    <strong>Email etiquette: ALWAYS respond to direct emails</strong>
        <p>Not responding to a personal email is a major breach of
          professional etiquette (and general civility). Imagine how pissed off you would be if you
          met me along the corridor, said 'Hi Damith, good morning' and I walked away without saying
          anything back. Not responding to a personal email is just as bad. Always take a few seconds
          to at least acknowledge such emails.  It doesn't take long to type "Noted. Thanks" and hit 'send'.</p>
        <p>The promptness of a reply is even more important when the email is requesting you for
          something that you cannot provide. Imagine you wrote to me requesting a reference letter and
          I did not respond at all because I didn't want to give you one; You'll be quite frustrated
          because you wouldn't know whether to look for another professor or wait longer for my
          response. Saying 'No' is fine and in fact a necessary part of professional life; but saying
          nothing is not acceptable. If you didn't reply, the sender will not even know whether
          you received the email.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<h3>Policy on tech help</h3>
<div id="policy-techHelp">
  <p><span class="highlighted">Do not expect your project tutor to code or debug for you</span>. We
    strongly discourage tutors from giving technical help directly to their own teams because,we want to train you in
    troubleshooting tech problems yourselves. Allowing direct tech help from tutors transfers the troubleshooting
    responsibility to tutors.</p>
  <p><span class="highlighted">It is ok to ask for help from classmates even for assignments</span>,
    even from other teams, as long as you don't copy from others and submit as your own. It doesn't
    matter who is helping you as long as you are learning from it.</p>
  <p><span class="highlighted">We encourage you to give tech help to each other</span>, but do it in
    a way that the other person learns from it.</p>
  <p>Please refer <a href="#handbook-appendixD-help">Appendix D: How to get Help in CS2103/T</a>.</p>
</div>

<h3>Policy on publishing submissions</h3>
<div id="policy-publishingSubmissions">
  <p>The source code are publicly available and are available for reuse by others without any restrictions. <br/>
    Is publishing submissions unfair to the team? We don't think so. If you were the first to think of
    something your peers are willing to adopt later, that means you are already ahead of them and they
    are unlikely to earn more marks by adopting your ideas.</p>
</div>

<h3>Policy on plagiarism</h3>
<div id="policy-plagiarism">
  <p>What's allowed:</p>
  <p>We encourage sharing, but you should share with everyone in the class, not just a selected
    group. That is,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are not allowed to share individual assignments with classmates directly.</li>
    <li>You are not allowed to share project-related things with other teams directly.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, note that most submissions will be published to the class after the submission
    deadline, after which they <span class="highlighted">can be 'reused' by others</span> subject to
    the 'reuse policy' given below.</p>
  <p>If you submit code taken from elsewhere, you need to comply with our reuse policy.</p>
  <p>Detection: </p>
  <p>Detecting plagiarism in code is quite easy. You are not fooling anyone by reordering code or
    renaming methods/variables. Besides, all your submissions are published to the class and sooner or
    later somebody will notice the plagiarism.</p>
  <p>Penalties:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For activities earning participation marks: We make a record of cases of plagiarism but we
      do not take further action. Because participation marks are given for effort and all students
      can earn the full marks easily, such plagiarism does not disadvantage other students.
      Therefore, we prefer to spend all available resources on helping honest students to do better
      rather than to chase after dishonest students. If you think you gain something by plagiarizing,
      go ahead and do it. It's your choice and it's your loss.
    </li>
    <li>For the final project/exam: Any case of claiming others' work as yours will be reported to the university for
      disciplinary action.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>Policy on reuse</h3>
<div id="policy-reuse">
  <p>In general, <span class="highlighted">reuse is encouraged</span>. However, note that reuse has
    its own costs (such as the learning curve, additional complexity, usage restrictions, and unknown
    bugs). Furthermore, you will not be given credit for work done by others. Rather, you will be
    given credit for using work done by others.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are allowed to reuse work from your classmates, subject to following conditions:
      <ul>
        <li>The work has been published by us or the authors.</li>
        <li>You clearly give credit to the original author(s).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>You are allowed to reuse work from external sources, subject to following conditions:
      <ul>
        <li>The work comes from a source of 'good standing' (such as an established open source
          project). This means you cannot reuse code written by an outside 'friend'.
        </li>
        <li>You clearly give credit to the original author. Acknowledge use of third party resources
          clearly e.g. in the welcome message, splash screen (if any) or under the 'about'
          menu. If you are open about reuse, you are less likely to get into trouble if you
          unintentionally reused something copyrighted.
        </li>
        <li>You do not violate the license under which the work has been released. Please <span class="highlighted">
      do not use 3rd-party images/audio</span> in your software unless they have
          been specifically released to be used freely. Just because you found it in the Internet does
          not mean it is free for reuse.
        </li>
        <li><span class="highlighted">Always get permission from us before you reuse</span> things
          from elsewhere. Please post your 'request to use 3rd party library' in IVLE forum
          for approval. That way, the whole class get to see what libraries are being used by others.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>Policy on help from outsiders</h3>
<div id="policy-outsiderHelp">
  <p>In general, you are <span class="highlighted">not allowed to involve outsiders</span> in your
    project except your team members and the teaching team. However, It is OK to give your product to
    others for the purpose of getting voluntary user feedback. It is also OK to learn from others as
    long as they don't do your project work themselves.</p>
</div>

<h3>Policy on suggested length for submissions</h3>
<div id="policy-submissionLength">
  <p>We don't usually give a page limit for submissions. You need to decide yourself how long the document should be
    based on the purpose and the intended audience. You can determine the level of details required based on the
    samples we provide. </p>
  <br/>
