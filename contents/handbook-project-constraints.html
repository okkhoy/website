<p>
  You should also comply with the following constraints. The purpose of these constraints is to increase
  comparability among submissions and to maximize applicability of module content in the project.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong> Constraint-Morph</strong>: The final product should be a result of morphing the given sample code. i.e.
    enhance and/or evolve the given code to arrive at the new software.
    <br>
    Reason: To ensure your code has a decent quality level from the start.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Constraint-Desktop</strong>: The software should be a desktop app (i.e. not a Mobile or a Web app).
    Reason: Desktop apps are more general than other platforms such as mobile/embedded/web and therefore,
    provides a good starting point before you move to those platforms.
    <br>
    You are allowed to integrate with online services such as Google Calendar as long as the app can provide a reasonable
    level of functionality even when offline.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Constraint-CLI</strong>: Command Line Interface is the primary mode of input. If you implement a GUI, it
    should be primarily for output. That is, the GUI is used to give visual feedback rather than to collect input. Some
    minimal use of mouse is OK (e.g. to click the minimize button), but the primary input should be command-driven.
    Mouse actions should have keyboard alternatives and typing is preferred over key combinations. Design the app in a
    way that you can do stuff faster by typing compared to mouse or key combinations.
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Constraint-Standalone</strong>: The software should work stand-alone. It should not be a
    plug-in to another software. However, you can build optional extensions that integrate your application
    with other existing software. Furthermore, you are allowed to build extensions that can plug into your
    software.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Constraint-No-Database</strong>: The software should not use relational databases. Data
    storage must be done using text files you create yourself.
    <br>
    Reason: Using relational databases reduces the scope for applying Object-oriented techniques.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Constraint-Human-Editable-File</strong>: The data should be stored locally and should be in a
    human editable text file. The intention of this constraint is to allow advanced users to manipulate the
    data by editing the data file.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Constraint-OO</strong>: The software should follow the Object-oriented paradigm.
    <br>
    Reason: For you to practice OOP that you learned in the course.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Constraint-Windows</strong>: The software should work on the Windows 7 or later.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Constraint-No-Installer</strong>: The software should work without requiring an installer.
    Having an optional installer is OK as longs as the portable (non-installed) version has all the critical
    functionality.
    <br>
    Reason: We do not want to install all your projects on our testing machines when we test them for grading.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong> Constraint-External-Software</strong>: The use of third-party frameworks/libraries is
    allowed but only if they,
    <ul>
      <li>
        are free.
      </li>
      <li>
        do not require any installation by the user of your software.
      </li>
      <li>
        do not violate other constraints.
      </li>
    </ul>
    and subject to prior approval by us. We will not allow third-party software that can interfere with the
    learning objectives of the module.
    <br>
    Please post your request for approval in IVLE forum before you start using the library.
    <br>
    Reason: The whole class should know which external software are used by others so that they can do the same if
    they wish to.
  </li>
</ul>
