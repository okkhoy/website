<p>
  Your tutor for phase B will also be your project supervisor. <br>
  Tutorial time is the main avenue for meeting your tutor. In addition, you can meet the tutor before/after the
  tutorial, or any other time, as many times you need, subject to availability in his/her schedule. However, please note
  that it is not the tutorâ€™s job to chase you down and give help. It is up to you to get as much feedback from the
  project tutor as you need.<br>
  Furthermore, it is not the job of the project supervisor to lead your project to success. His/job is to observe,
  evaluate, and give feedback. You are free to request more feedback from the tutor as necessary.
