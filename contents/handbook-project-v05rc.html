<h3>V0.5rc Product</h3>
<p>
  Functionality expectations: <strong> Freeze features</strong> after reaching this milestone.
  As this is a ‘release candidate’ it should have all the features you intend to release.
  Adding more features after this point is risky. The remaining time should be left
  aside for fixing problems discovered late.<br>
  Other suggestions:
<ul>
  <li>Dogfood your product intensively and improve it based on your findings.</li>
  <li>Bring code coverage near to your target if it is low.</li>
  <li>After you have sufficient code coverage, fix remaining code quality problems and bring up the
    quality to the level you target.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<strong>Submission</strong>: as before.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Grading</strong>: Your product should show significant progress since the previous milestone.
